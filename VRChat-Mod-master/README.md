# VRChat-Mod

Go to your Steam folder and go to common\VRChat\VRChat_Data\Managed\ and move Assembly-CSharp.dll and VRCheat.dll into the Managed folder (Replacing Assembly-CSharp.dll)

Start your game (If a console window pops up then you did it right)

# How to use:

**At the top left of the screen you can see what your display name is so you can keep track of it when copying people's names**

While a player is selected (press escape and click on their avatar), you can press these keys:

* **Right Mouse Button:** Copy their avatar
* **Middle Mouse Button:** Save their avatar (Console will ask avatar's name)
* **T:** Teleport to that player
* **N:** Copy that player's displayname
* **M:** Send that player a notification message

For the following keys you don't need to have a player selected:

* **CTRL + N:** Change your name to whatever you want (Console will ask for name)
* **CTRL + G:** Teleport to a specific player (Console will show you a playerlist and ask you to type in a substring of the player's name)
* **CTRL + R:** Toggles a randomly changing name
* **CTRL + DEL:** Deletes your current avatar from your personal avatars (Assuming your current avatar is saved)
* **CTRL + M:** Teleport every pickup item to you (Might cause a crash when changing worlds)
* **CTRL + O:** Follow a user into their world (Console will ask for user's name)
* **CTRL + F:** Toggle fly mode (Use Q and E for going up/down)
* **CTRL + Middle Mouse Button:** Save avatar by ID

# There are some other features but they're easy to see by reading the source code
